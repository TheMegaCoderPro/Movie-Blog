  <h2>#1 Wakfu</h2>
  <img src="https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple118/v4/54/4e/f2/544ef25c-cadd-f770-8575-e4a0ac1d39f1/pr_source.jpg/576x768bb.jpg">
  <p>Wakfu is a tactical turn-based MMORPG, developed by Ankama Games. Development began in 2006, and the game was released for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux on February 29, 2012. The game takes place 1,000 years after Ankama's previous game, Dofus. A spin-off game, Islands of Wakfu, was released on Xbox Live Arcade on March 30, 2011. An animated television series based on the game began airing in France from October 30, 2008. The series has also spawned various comics, a trading card game and a board game.
    In the time of Dofus, an ogre named Ogrest managed to get all six Dofus eggs for the sake of someone he loved. However, she was interested only in the eggs, and Ogrest killed her in a fit of rage. Later realizing what he'd done, he climbed atop Mount Zinit and cried for 1,000 years. This brings us to the time of WAKFU. Now the "goal" is to defeat Ogrest, but, like in Dofus, this is not necessary.
    The timeline has moved thusfar that the Ogrest is no longer the main villain of the story. It appears that it was not the Ogrest who caused this world to flood, but the Eliotrope OROPO. In the battle between Ogrest versus Yugo, Yugo gained control over the six Eliatrope Dofus and created alternate versions of himself, and then sent them back into the past. This also explains the appearance of the Eliotrope class in the game.</p>
    <h2>#2 Raising Dion</h2>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/readysteadycut.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/raising-dion-s2-crop-1.jpeg?fit=780%2C410&ssl=1">
<p>Raising Dion is an American superhero drama streaming television series that premiered on October 4, 2019 on Netflix. It is based on the 2015 comic book and short film of the same name by Dennis Liu. In January 2020, Netflix renewed the series for a second season which premiered on February 1, 2022.
  Raising Dion follows the story of a woman named Nicole who raises her son Dion after the death of her husband Mark. The normal dramas of raising a son as a single mom are amplified when Dion starts to manifest several magical, superhero-like abilities. Nicole must now keep her son's gifts secret with the help of Mark's best friend Pat, and protect Dion from people out to exploit him while figuring out the origin of his abilities.

<h2>#3 Pokemon</h2>
<img src="https://d24hkyf7t7q9y9.cloudfront.net/articles/2016/03/how-many-units-has-pokemon-sold-again-1458222052522.jpg">
<p>Pokémon[a] is a series of video games developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company under the Pokémon media franchise. Created by Satoshi Tajiri with assistance from Ken Sugimori, the first games, Pocket Monsters Red and Green, released in 1996 in Japan for the Game Boy, later released outside of Japan as Pokémon Red and Blue. The main series of role-playing video games (RPGs), referred as the "core series" by their developers, have continued on each generation of Nintendo's handhelds. The most recently released core series game, Pokémon Legends: Arceus, was released on January 28, 2022, for the Nintendo Switch. It is a prequel to the 2006 Nintendo DS games Pokémon Diamond and Pearl.

  The core games are released in generations, each with different Pokémon, storylines, and characters. Remakes of the games are usually released around a decade after the original versions for the latest console at the time. While the main series consists of RPGs developed by Game Freak, many spin-off games based on the series have been developed by various companies, encompassing other genres such as action role-playing, puzzle, fighting, and digital pet games.
  
  Pokémon is estimated to be the largest media franchise, with successful anime series, movies, and merchandise, with spin-off game Pokémon Go having crossed 1 billion mobile game downloads worldwide. By November 24, 2017, more than 300 million Pokémon games had been sold worldwide on handheld and home consoles, across 76 titles, including spin-offs. As of March 2021, the series has sold over 380 million units worldwide. This makes Pokémon the fourth best-selling video game franchise, behind Nintendo's own Mario franchise, Tetris and Call of Duty.

<h2>#4 Sonic</h2>
<img src="https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Sonic-The-Hedgehog-2-Trailer-Easter-Eggs.jpg?fit=1200%2C675">
<p>Sonic the Hedgehog[b] is a 2020 action-adventure comedy film directed by Jeff Fowler (in his feature directorial debut) and written by Pat Casey and Josh Miller, based on the video game franchise published by Sega. It stars Ben Schwartz as the voice of Sonic with the rest of the cast consisting of James Marsden, Tika Sumpter, and Jim Carrey. It is the first installment in a planned Sonic the Hedgehog film series. The film follows Sonic the Hedgehog (voiced by Schwartz), a hedgehog who can run supersonic speeds as he teams up with local town sheriff Tom Wachowski (Marsden) to stop the sinister mad scientist Dr. Robotnik (Carrey), who seeks to use Sonic's superpowers to conquer the Earth.

  Development for a Sonic film began in the 1990s but did not leave the planning stage until Sony Pictures acquired the rights in 2013. Fowler was brought in to direct in 2016. After Sony put the project in turnaround, Paramount Pictures acquired it in 2017. Most of the cast signed on by August 2018, and principal filming took place between September and October that year in Vancouver and on Vancouver Island. Following the negative reaction to the first trailer in 2019, Paramount delayed the film by three months to redesign Sonic.
  
  Sonic the Hedgehog premiered at the Paramount Pictures studio lot on January 25, 2020, before being theatrically released in the United States on February 14, 2020, by Paramount Pictures. It set the record for the biggest opening weekend for a video game film in the United States and Canada and grossed $319.7 million worldwide, becoming the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2020, and is the highest-grossing video game film adaptation of all time in North America. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the action scenes, Sonic's charm, and Schwartz, Marsden and Carrey's performances, but criticized its screenplay, product placement, and lack of ambition.[9] Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is scheduled for release in April 2022. A third film and a spin-off series starring Knuckles are in development.

  On a distant planet, Sonic, an anthropomorphic blue hedgehog who can run at supersonic speed, is chased by a tribe of echidnas for his power. His guardian, Longclaw the Owl, gives him a bag of rings that open portals to other planets. She uses one to send him to Earth while she stays behind to hold off the echidnas.

Ten years later, Sonic enjoys a secret life near the town of Green Hills, Montana, but longs to make friends. He idolizes the local sheriff, Tom Wachowski, calling him "Donut Lord", and his veterinarian wife, Maddie, calling her "Pretzel Lady", unaware the pair are planning to relocate to San Francisco, as Tom, bored with the lack of action in Green Hills, plans to accept a position he has just been offered with the San Francisco Police Department.

One night, Sonic becomes upset over his loneliness while playing baseball by himself and starts running at high speeds in a circle, accidentally triggering an electromagnetic pulse which causes a large-scale power outage across the Pacific Northwest instead. The United States Department of Defense reluctantly enlists the services of eccentric roboticist and scientific genius Dr. Robotnik to determine the cause. Sonic, in a state of shock, flees from his underground home, but Tom discovers Sonic in his shed and accidentally shoots him with a tranquilizer dart, causing Sonic to see the Transamerica Pyramid on Tom's shirt and accidentally drop his bag of rings through a portal to the top of the same building instead of the "mushroom planet" he was planning to travel to. Tom hesitantly agrees to help Sonic and the two flee when confronted by Robotnik, who falsely labels Tom a domestic terrorist. The two slowly bond, with Tom finding himself sympathetic to Sonic's desire for a real friend. Sonic creates a bucket list and Tom helps him complete several entries along their journey.

Having recovered one of Sonic's quills, Robotnik analyzes it and discovers it holds an almost limitless amount of electrical energy. He decides to capture Sonic and use him to power his machines. As he tracks them down, Sonic and Tom debate over Tom's plans to leave Green Hills, which Sonic disapproves of because, regardless of how much action there needs to be, he knows Tom still has to protect and serve Green Hill's citizens. Sonic and Tom manage to fight off several mechanized pursuit drones sent by Robotnik until Sonic is badly injured after the battle.

Arriving in San Francisco, Tom brings him to Maddie, who treats him at her sister Rachel's home. While Tom explains their situation to her, Sonic receives a new pair of red sneakers to replace his ruined ones from Jojo, Maddie's niece. The group soon heads to the roof of the pyramid and recovers the rings. Robotnik arrives, piloting an advanced attack hovercraft powered by the quill. Sonic taunts Robotnik by calling him "Eggman" after his egg-shaped drones. Despite Robotnik matching his speed using the quill's power, Sonic fights off Robotnik's drones and uses one of his rings to send Tom and Maddie back to Green Hills to protect them.

Robotnik pursues Sonic across the world through San Francisco, France, China, and Egypt – inadvertently completing several of Sonic's bucket list entries in the process – ultimately returning to Green Hills. Robotnik knocks Sonic unconscious, but Tom and the townsfolk intervene, and Tom says that Sonic is his friend, causing Sonic to regain his strength. Sonic then defeats Robotnik by opening a portal to send him to the mushroom planet, through the force of an electromagnetic-powered spin dash. Following the incident, Tom and Maddie decide to stay in Green Hills and let Sonic live with them. The government agrees to hide Sonic's existence by erasing all evidence of the events, including records of Robotnik's existence.

Three months later, Robotnik is still in possession of Sonic's quill and usable equipment salvaged from the remains of his hovercraft. While shaving his head, he swears to return to Earth and exact revenge against Sonic. Tails, a two-tailed fox, emerges from a ring portal on Earth to search for Sonic.

<h2>#5 Avenger Endgame & Infintify War</h2>
<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/imageresize/avengers-endgame-or-avengers-infinity-war-which-robert-downey-jr-film-is-the-greatest-mcu-film-of-all-time.jpg?width=752&format=webp&t=pvorg">
<p>Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame are American superhero films based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. They are the sequels to Marvel's The Avengers (2012) and Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), and serve as the 19th and 22nd films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), respectively. Both films are directed by Anthony and Joe Russo from screenplays by the writing team of Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, and feature an ensemble cast composed of many previous MCU actors.

  Development of the films began in Marvel Studios' early films by introducing the Infinity Stones and the Infinity Gauntlet as plot devices. Casting began in mid-2013 with Robert Downey Jr. signing on to reprise his role as Tony Stark / Iron Man, with the films officially announced a year later as Avengers: Infinity War, Part 1 and Part 2. The Russo brothers and Markus and McFeely joined the project in early 2015. In July 2016, Marvel revealed that the films were being renamed: the first part became known simply as Avengers: Infinity War, while the second part's title was revealed as Avengers: Endgame in December 2018. The films were renamed because they were intended to tell two different stories. They were designed as a conclusion to the storyline told in all the MCU films up to that point.
  
  Both films were shot back-to-back at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia. Production of Infinity War began on January 23, and concluded on July 14, 2017, with additional filming in Scotland, the Downtown Atlanta area, and New York City. Filming of Avengers: Endgame began on August 10, 2017 and concluded on January 11, 2018, with additional filming in the Downtown and Metro Atlanta areas, New York state, Scotland, and England. They are the first Hollywood films to be shot entirely in digital IMAX, using a new camera developed alongside Arri. Industrial Light & Magic, Framestore, Method Studios, Weta Digital, DNEG, Cinesite, Digital Domain, Rise, Lola VFX, Perception, Cantina Creative, Capital T, Technicolor VFX, and Territory Studio were the visual effects companies to work on the films.
  
  Avengers: Infinity War was released on April 27, 2018, and Avengers: Endgame was released on April 26, 2019, both part of Phase Three of the MCU.</p>
